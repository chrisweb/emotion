title: 'ESLint Plugin React'
---

The eslint rule react/no-unknown-property from the [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) package, with a version > 7.31.1, got a fix which now triggers an eslint error if the emotion css property is used on an element.

To fix this linting error one solution is to add the following rule to your eslintrc.* configuration file:

eslintrc.js example:

```js
    "rules": {
        "react/no-unknown-property": ['error', { ignore: ['css'] }]
    }
```

eslintrc.json example:

```json
    "rules": {
        "react/no-unknown-property": ["error", { "ignore": ["css"] }]
    },
```

eslintrc.yaml example:

```yaml
rules:
  react/no-unknown-property:
    - error
    - ignore: ["css"]
```

> Note
>
> You might want to fine tune your eslint configuration and only apply this rule to a file or a group of files in which the emotion css property is actually being used, to do so you can use the overrides key in your eslint configuration: [ESLint documentation: How do overrides work?](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/configuring/configuration-files#how-do-overrides-work)
